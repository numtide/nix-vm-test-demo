# Nix-VM-Test Usage Example

This repository contains the code for the [nix-vm-test](https://github.com/numtide/nix-vm-test/) live demo.

We're packaging [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) for Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu using nfpm. We're then testing the resulting artifacts using nix-vm-test.

**NOTE:** we're packaging Garage only for demonstration purposes here. DO NOT USE THESE PACKAGES FOR ANY REAL USAGE. We won't maintain the generated packages up to date.
